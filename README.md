## APA FIB UPC 2023 Q1
This Jupyter Notebooks are a first analisis for different problems than can (or can not) be solved using different machine learning techniques. All notebooks have been graded betwen 9-10.

## Requirements
Most of this problems use the `apafib` library. For running the notebooks again you will need it. You can install it by running this command:
```bash
pip install apafib
```

## Notes
This problem can be taken much more further than my analisis so feel free to try more ideas!
